Work as though everything depended on you.\u201d","-St. Augustine","\u201cDon\u2019t you long to shout to those youths who are bustling around you: Fools!

Everything else we do is a means to an end. But love is an end already, since God is love.\u201d","-St. Teresia Benedicta (Edith Stein)","\u201cIf you are what you should be, you will set the whole world ablaze!\u201d","-St. Catherine of Sienna","\u201cLord, make me an instrument of your peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.\u201d","-St. Francis","\u201cOur hearts were made for You, O Lord, and they are restless until they rest in you.\u201d","-St. Augustine of Hippo","\u201cCharity is certainly greater than any rule.

It was said to them: \u2018Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose, shall be loosed.\u2019 Temporal rulers have indeed the power of binding; but they can only bind the body. Priests, in contrast, can bind with a bond which pertains to the soul itself and transcends the very heavens. Did [God] not give them all the powers of heaven?\u2026What greater power is there than this? The Father has given all judgment to the Son. And now I see the Son placing all this power in the hands of men.

For it is not small to one who has nothing. Neither is it small to God, if we have given what we could.\u201d","-St. Gregory Nazianzen","\u201cChrist be with me, Christ within me, Christ behind me, Christ before me, Christ beside me, Christ to win me, Christ to comfort me and restore me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ in quiet, Christ in danger, Christ in hearts of all that love me, Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.\u201d","-St. Patrick","\u201cChrist said, \u201cI am the Truth\u201d; he did not say \u201cI am the custom.\u201d","-St. Toribio","\u201cAll the efforts of the human mind cannot exhaust the essence of a single fly.\u201d","-St. Thomas Aquinas","\u201cThere are more tears shed over answered prayers than over unanswered prayers.\u201d","-St. Teresa of Avila","\u201cI have no taste for corruptible food nor for the pleasures of this life.

Has anyone ever witnessed anything comparable to this? Let the philosopher no longer disdain from listening to the common laborer; the wise, to the simple; the educated, to the illiterate; a child of a prince, to a peasant.\u201d","-St. Anthony of Padua","\u201cCharity is that with which no man is lost, and without which no man is saved.\u201d","-St. Robert Bellarmine","\u201cWhether, therefore, we receive what we ask for, or do not receive it, let us still continue steadfast in prayer.

If He came down on our altars on certain days only, some sinner, on being moved to repentance, might have to look for Him, and not finding Him, might have to wait. Our Lord prefers to wait Himself for the sinner for years rather than keep him waiting one instant.\u201d","-St. Julian Peter Eymard","\u201cLove is the most necessary of all virtues. Love in the person who preaches the word of God is like fire in a musket. If a person were to throw a bullet with his hands, he would hardly make a dent in anything; but if the person takes the same bullet and ignites some gunpowder behind it, it can kill. It is much the same with the word of God. If it is spoken by someone who is filled with the fire of charity- the fire of love of God and neighbor- it will work wonders.\u201d","-St. Anthony Mary Claret","\u201cOur Lord loves you and loves you tenderly; and if He does not let you feel the sweetness of His love, it is to make you more humble and abject in your own eyes.\u201d","-St. Pio of Pietrelcino","\u201cYou learn to speak by speaking, to study by studying, to run by running, to work by working, and just so, you learn to love by loving.
